This note focuses on the crucial actions required to ensure data privacy when implementing systems that collect and process telemetry data (metrics, traces, logs).

## Essential Actions for Telemetry Data Privacy

**Question:** Which of the following actions is essential for addressing data privacy concerns when implementing telemetry systems?

**Answer Principle:** Essential actions include **strictly limiting the collection of personal or sensitive information (Data Minimization), collecting non-personal aggregated data where possible, implementing data masking or anonymization, ensuring secure transport/storage, and establishing clear retention policies.**

**Explanation:**
Collecting telemetry data inherently carries privacy risks if not managed carefully. Addressing these concerns is vital for compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and user trust. Key essential actions include:

1. **Data Minimization & Selective Collection:** This is a crucial first step.
    * **Limit Collection:** Strictly limit the collection of any Personal or Sensitive Information (PSI/PII). Avoid collecting it altogether if it's not absolutely essential for the observability task.
    * **Focus on Non-Personal/Aggregated Data:** Where possible, collect non-personal, aggregated data rather than detailed individual records. This helps meet compliance requirements while still providing valuable insights.
2. **Data Identification & Classification:** If potentially sensitive data *must* be collected, understand precisely what it is, where it appears (logs, trace attributes, metric labels), and classify its sensitivity.
3. **Masking/Anonymization/Scrubbing:** Implement mechanisms (often via OpenTelemetry SDK configuration or Collector processors like the `attributes` processor) to automatically remove, hash, obscure, or replace sensitive data fields *before* they are exported or stored (e.g., masking credit card numbers in logs, hashing user IDs).
4. **Secure Transport & Storage:** Ensure telemetry data is encrypted both in transit (TLS) and at rest in the observability backend.
5. **Access Control:** Restrict access to raw or sensitive telemetry data to authorized personnel based on roles and responsibilities.
6. **Retention Policies:** Define and enforce policies for how long telemetry data is stored, ensuring it's deleted after it's no longer needed for its specified purpose.
7. **Transparency:** Be transparent (e.g., in privacy policies) about what data is collected, why, and how it's protected.

By prioritizing data minimization and employing techniques like masking, organizations can leverage telemetry effectively while upholding privacy standards and complying with regulations.

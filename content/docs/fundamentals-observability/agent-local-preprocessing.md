This note discusses the advantages of performing telemetry data preprocessing locally using an OpenTelemetry Agent, typically the OpenTelemetry Collector deployed alongside the application.

## Local Preprocessing with an Agent

**Question:** In which scenario would using an OpenTelemetry Agent for local data preprocessing be most beneficial?

**Answer Principle:** Using an Agent for local preprocessing is most beneficial for scenarios involving **data reduction (sampling, filtering), enrichment (adding metadata), batching, and ensuring data privacy (masking sensitive information)** before the data leaves the local environment or host.

**Explanation:**
Deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector as an Agent on the same host as the application allows for several preprocessing steps:

- **Batching:** Grouping telemetry data points before sending reduces the number of outgoing network connections and potentially lowers egress costs.
- **Filtering/Sampling:** Dropping noisy or irrelevant data close to the source reduces the volume of data transmitted and stored, saving costs and processing load downstream.
- **Enrichment:** Adding local context (e.g., host metadata, container ID) that might not be easily available further down the pipeline.
- **Privacy:** Masking or removing sensitive data (PII) before it leaves the trusted boundary of the host or local network.
- **Reliability:** The agent can retry sending data if the backend is temporarily unavailable, buffering data locally.

Performing these tasks locally minimizes the load on the network and the central observability backend, improves data quality and compliance, and can optimize costs.

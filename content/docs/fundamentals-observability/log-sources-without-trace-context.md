This note discusses log sources that, due to their nature or origin, usually cannot be easily modified to include trace context information (like trace ID and span ID).

## Log Sources Typically Lacking Trace Context

**Question:** Which type of log source in OpenTelemetry cannot be modified to include trace context information and typically follows a predefined format like Syslog or Windows Event Logs?

**Answer Principle:** **System-level logs** (e.g., Syslog, Windows Event Logs, kernel logs) and logs from **third-party systems** where you cannot modify the logging output are types where trace context typically cannot be injected directly at the source.

**Explanation:**
Trace context propagation relies on the ability to *add* the current trace ID and span ID to the log record when it is generated. This is straightforward within application code instrumented with OpenTelemetry SDKs.

However, certain log sources present challenges:

- **Operating System Logs (Syslog, Windows Event Log, Journald):** These logs are generated by the OS itself or system services. They follow strict, predefined formats, and the OS services generating them are not typically instrumented with application-level trace context. You cannot easily modify the OS kernel or system daemons to include your application's trace ID.
- **Third-Party Systems/Appliances:** Logs generated by external systems, black-box appliances (like load balancers, firewalls), or managed services (some database logs) often have fixed formats and cannot be modified by the end-user to include OpenTelemetry trace context.

While OpenTelemetry collectors or log agents *might* be able to correlate these logs with traces later based on other metadata (like timestamps, hostnames, IP addresses), the trace context is not *injected* into the log record at the time of creation for these types of sources.

**Reference:**

- OpenTelemetry Documentation: [Logs Data Model - Trace Context Fields](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#trace-context-fields) (Describes the fields `TraceId` and `SpanId`).
- OpenTelemetry Documentation: [Logs Bridge API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/bridge-api/) (Explains how applications *can* emit logs with context).
- General Concept: The limitation arises from the inability to modify the log generation process for external or system-level sources, which isn't explicitly stated as a limitation *of OpenTelemetry* but is an inherent constraint of interacting with such systems.

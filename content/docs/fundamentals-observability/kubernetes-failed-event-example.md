This note gives examples of typical events or resource states within the Kubernetes ecosystem that signify a failure, often captured as part of observability data.

## Example of a Kubernetes Failure Scenario

**Question:** Which of the following is an example of a Failed Event [scenario] in Kubernetes?

**Answer Principle:** A Kubernetes "Failed Event" scenario signifies a critical issue preventing normal operation. A primary example is a **container crash**, often indicated by Pods entering states like `CrashLoopBackOff` or frequent restarts accompanied by related events.

**Explanation:**
Kubernetes generates events to report on resource state changes. While there isn't a single `Type=Failed` that covers all failure scenarios, many `Warning` events, or specific `Reason` codes, indicate that an operation could not be completed successfully or that a component is unhealthy. Critical failures often manifest as specific Pod states or event patterns.

Examples indicating failures include:

- **Container Crashes:** A container repeatedly starting and failing often leads to a Pod status like `CrashLoopBackOff`. This state, along with associated events (which might have `Reason: BackOff`), signifies a persistent failure within the containerized application.
- **`FailedScheduling`:** The scheduler cannot find a suitable node for a Pod, indicating a failure to place the workload due to unmet constraints. (Type: `Warning`)
- **Image Pull Issues (`Failed`, `ErrImagePull`, `ImagePullBackOff`):** Events indicating the container runtime could not pull the specified container image, preventing the container from starting. (Type: `Warning`)
- **`FailedCreatePodSandBox`:** The kubelet failed to create the Pod's network sandbox, a critical failure preventing the Pod from running. (Type: `Warning`)
- **`Evicted`:** A Pod was evicted from a node, often due to resource pressure, representing a failure for that Pod instance on that node. (Type: `Warning` or `Normal`, Reason: `Evicted`)
- **Readiness/Liveness Probe Failures (`Unhealthy`):** Events indicating a probe failed, signifying an application failure within the container. (Type: `Warning`, Reason: `Unhealthy`)

Recognizing these events and states is vital for maintaining system reliability and diagnosing problems within a Kubernetes cluster. They represent failures even if the event `Type` isn't explicitly "Failed".

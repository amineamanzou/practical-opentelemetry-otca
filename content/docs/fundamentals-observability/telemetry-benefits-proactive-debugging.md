This note explores how the Performance Monitoring aspect, enabled by telemetry data, allows development teams to proactively identify and resolve application and infrastructure problems.

## Leveraging Performance Monitoring via Telemetry

**Question:** A development team wants to proactively identify and fix issues like database errors and JVM problems in their application. Which telemetry benefit should they leverage?

**Answer Principle:** The team should leverage **Performance Monitoring**, enabled by telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces).

**Explanation:**
Performance Monitoring is the telemetry benefit that allows development teams to track various performance metrics and diagnose infrastructure-related issues, such as database errors (e.g., connection timeouts, query failures) and JVM problems (e.g., excessive garbage collection, high heap usage, deadlocks).

How Performance Monitoring helps:

- **Tracking Key Metrics:** Telemetry provides metrics crucial for monitoring databases (error rates, query latency, connection pool status) and JVMs (heap size, GC frequency/duration, thread count).
- **Diagnosing Issues:** When metrics indicate a problem (e.g., a spike in DB errors or high JVM memory usage), correlated logs provide specific error messages and stack traces, while traces pinpoint the exact requests or operations experiencing issues.
- **Proactive Identification:** By continuously monitoring these performance aspects using telemetry data and setting up alerts on key indicators, teams can detect deviations and potential problems *before* they escalate into user-facing outages.
- **Bottleneck Resolution:** This proactive insight enables teams to address and resolve performance bottlenecks related to database interactions, JVM tuning, or other dependencies, ensuring a more stable and efficient application.

Leveraging Performance Monitoring through telemetry shifts the team from reactive troubleshooting to proactive problem identification and resolution.

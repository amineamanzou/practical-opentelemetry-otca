This note clarifies the definition of telemetry data as it relates to understanding and monitoring complex systems, particularly within observability practices.

## Defining Telemetry Data

**Question:** How is telemetry data best defined in the context of system monitoring?

**Answer Principle:** Telemetry data is the **automatic collection and remote transmission of system data**, including **logs, metrics, events, and traces**, for monitoring and analysis purposes.

**Explanation:**
Telemetry involves the automated process of gathering diverse data types from systems (hardware or software) and transmitting them to a central or remote location. The core purpose is to enable monitoring, analysis, troubleshooting, and overall observability.

Key aspects highlighted in this definition:

- **Automatic Collection:** Data generation and gathering are typically automated through instrumentation (e.g., using OpenTelemetry SDKs) or system agents, minimizing manual intervention.
- **Remote Transmission:** Data is sent from its source (application, server, device) to an observability backend or platform.
- **Comprehensive Data Types:** It encompasses various signals critical for understanding system behavior:
  - **Metrics:** Quantitative measurements (e.g., request counts, latency).
  - **Traces:** Records of request paths through distributed systems.
  - **Logs:** Timestamped records of discrete events.
  - **(Events):** Often considered a type of log or a distinct signal representing significant occurrences. OpenTelemetry primarily focuses on logs, traces, and metrics.
- **Purpose:** To provide the necessary inputs for understanding system health, performance, and behavior, forming the foundation of observability.

This automated and comprehensive data collection allows teams to effectively manage system performance and health.

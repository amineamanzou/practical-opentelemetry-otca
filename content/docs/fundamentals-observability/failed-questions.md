This document organizes failed questions for the fundamentals of observability to help identify knowledge gaps and focus further study.

# Failed questions

- When defining new metrics in OpenTelemetry, which of the following practices helps facilitate discoverability and ad-hoc comparison?
- In which scenario would using an OpenTelemetry Agent for local data preprocessing be most beneficial?
- What is the preferred naming convention for an UpDownCounter representing the number of active processes in an OpenTelemetry metric namespace 'system.process'?
- Which of the following metric names adheres to OpenTelemetry's naming conventions regarding pluralization?
- According to OpenTelemetry guidelines, what should be checked to prevent name reuse when introducing a new metric name?
- Which of the following accurately describes a characteristic of semistructured logs in production observability?
- How is telemetry data best defined in the context of system monitoring?

- Which type of log source in OpenTelemetry cannot be modified to include trace context information and typically follows a predefined format like Syslog or Windows Event Logs?
- Given two spans with the same trace_id but different parent_id values, what does this imply about their relationship?

## Role of Views in Metric Aggregation

**Question:**
What is the role of Views in the OpenTelemetry API regarding metric aggregation?

**Answer:**
To customize the aggregation method and select specific metric attributes to report.

**Explanation:**
Views provide a powerful mechanism within the OpenTelemetry SDK (configured via the API) to customize how metric data from instruments is processed *before* being exported. Key capabilities include:

1. **Attribute Filtering:** Selecting which attributes (dimensions) recorded with an instrument measurement should be included in the aggregated metric. This helps control cardinality (the number of unique time series).
2. **Aggregation Customization:** Changing the default aggregation for an instrument (e.g., changing the default histogram bucket boundaries, or potentially changing a Sum to a LastValue, though this is less common and depends on SDK capabilities).
3. **Renaming Metrics:** Changing the name of the metric stream that gets exported.

Views allow developers to tailor the metric data generated by generic instrumentation or libraries to better suit their specific monitoring needs and backend constraints without modifying the instrumentation code itself.

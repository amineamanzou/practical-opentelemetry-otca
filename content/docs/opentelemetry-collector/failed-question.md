  - silent
- Which mode of operation does the OpenTelemetry Collector NOT support?
  - Serverless mode, integrating directly with cloud functions.
- What is a significant drawback of the agent collector deployment pattern in OpenTelemetry?
  - It has limited scalability and can become inflexible under increased load.
- In an OpenTelemetry setup, what temporality is used when the Collector receives data from a stateless client and is configured as a stateful server?
  - Delta temporality
- If the 'error_mode' is not specified in the transform processor configuration, what is the default mode?
  - propagate
- In the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration, how can a single receiver send telemetry data to multiple pipelines?
  - By listing the receiver in the receivers key of each pipeline.
- In an OpAMP setup, how can the OpAMP client side be implemented?
  - Both in-process within the Collector or out-of-process using a supervisor
- Which metric indicates that the OpenTelemetry Collector is refusing spans due to memory limitations?
  - otelcol_processor_refused_spans
- How does the OpenTelemetry data model ensure compatibility with the Prometheus Remote Write protocol?
  - By providing well-defined translations, including automatic attribute removal and histogram resolution lowering.
- In the OpenTelemetry Collector, what metric would you monitor to understand if your backend is slowing down the export process?
  - otelcol_loadbalancer_backend_latency
- In the transform processor's configuration, how are multiple global conditions within a context combined?
  - ORed together, at least one condition must be true.
- When deploying Jaeger using the All-in-One strategy, which component is not included in the single pod?
  - Prometheus Exporter
- Which method effectively distributes Prometheus scrape targets across multiple OpenTelemetry Collector instances to avoid duplicate scraping and out-of-order samples?
  - Sharding endpoints by assigning each Collector to specific Kubernetes namespaces or workload labels
- Which challenge is effectively addressed by deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector as an agent in environments using programming languages like Ruby or PHP?
  - Facilitating the collection of raw measurements and performing aggregation externally.
- When using the 'rename_attributes' transformation in the 'span_events' section, which optional fields can be used to restrict the transformation to specific spans or events?
  - apply_to_spans and apply_to_events
- Which processor in the OpenTelemetry Collector is responsible for converting raw event logs into structured data?
  - Transform Processor
- What happens when a pipeline in the OpenTelemetry Collector is configured with a data type that a receiver does not support?
  - The Collector throws a pipeline.ErrSignalNotSupported exception
- What is the purpose of deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector as a Deployment in Kubernetes?
  - To collect cluster-wide metrics and events.
- How are receivers enabled in the OpenTelemetry Collector?
  - By adding them to the appropriate pipelines within the service section.
- In the OpenTelemetry Collector's configuration for collecting Kubernetes events, which authentication type is typically specified in the Kubernetes Objects Receiver to access the Kubernetes API?
  - serviceAccount

## Analysis

Based on the failed questions, the following areas require further attention:

**Collector Configuration (`service` section):**

- Understanding how pipelines are defined and how components (receivers, processors, exporters) are connected.
- Syntax for enabling components and configuring multiple pipelines or exporters.
- Specific configuration details like handling empty maps (`{}`) and potential exceptions (`pipeline.ErrSignalNotSupported`).

**Processors (especially `transform` and `k8sattributes`):**

- Deep understanding of the `transform` processor's syntax (OpenTelemetry Transformation Language - OTTL), including functions (`rename_events`, `rename_attributes`), context (`span_events`), conditional logic (`where`), and error handling (`error_mode`).
- Purpose and configuration of the `k8sattributes` processor, including how to enable it (e.g., via Helm) and the metadata it adds.

**Deployment Strategies & Patterns:**

- Knowing the different Collector deployment patterns (Agent, Gateway/Collector Deployment) and their use cases, advantages, and disadvantages (e.g., scalability of agent).
- Kubernetes-specific deployments (DaemonSet vs. Deployment) and their purposes.
- Strategies for high availability and scalability, such as load balancing and sharding Prometheus targets.

**Kubernetes Integration:**

- Configuration of receivers interacting with Kubernetes (e.g., `k8sattributes` processor, Kubernetes Objects Receiver).
- Authentication mechanisms used for Kubernetes API access (`serviceAccount`).

**Collector Monitoring & Observability:**

- Identifying key metrics exposed by the Collector itself to monitor its health and performance (e.g., `otelcol_processor_refused_spans`, `otelcol_loadbalancer_backend_latency`).

**Data Handling & Interoperability:**

- Understanding data concepts like temporality (Delta vs. Cumulative) in different scenarios.
- How the Collector ensures compatibility with other systems like Prometheus (Remote Write).

**OpAMP (OpAMP Agent Management Protocol):**

- Basic knowledge of OpAMP's purpose and implementation options within the Collector ecosystem.

## Recommendations for Study

Focus your review on the following sections of the official OpenTelemetry Collector documentation:

- **Configuration:** Pay close attention to the `service` section, pipeline definitions, and the syntax for receivers, processors, and exporters.
  - [Collector Configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)
- **Processors:** Deep-dive into the documentation for specific processors, especially:
  - [Transform Processor (OTTL)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/transformations/)
  - [Kubernetes Attributes Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor)
- **Deployment:** Review the different deployment modes, strategies for Kubernetes, and considerations for scaling and high availability.
  - [Collector Deployment](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/)
  - [Collector Deployment - Kubernetes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/kubernetes/)
- **Receivers & Exporters:** Familiarize yourself with common components, especially those related to Kubernetes and Prometheus.
  - [Kubernetes Objects Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver) (Note: The question mentioned K8s Objects Receiver, k8sclusterreceiver is the current component)
  - [Prometheus Remote Write Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter)
- **Observability:** Understand how to monitor the Collector itself.
  - [Collector Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/monitoring/)
- **OpAMP:** Get a basic understanding of the protocol and its role.
  - [OpAMP Support](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/management/opamp/)

By focusing on these specific areas and relating the documentation back to the types of questions missed, you should be able to strengthen your understanding of the OpenTelemetry Collector for the OTCA exam.

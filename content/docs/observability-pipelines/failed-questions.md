This document organizes failed questions for debugging and maintaining observability pipelines to help identify knowledge gaps and focus further study.

## Failed questions

- When merging ExponentialHistograms with different zero_threshold values, which approach should be taken according to the specifications?
  - Use the largest zero_threshold and merge lower buckets into the common wider zero bucket.
- What is the purpose of the zero_count bucket in an ExponentialHistogram?
  - To store the count of values with absolute values less than or equal to zero_threshold.
- A development team wants to enable zPages for debugging the Collector in a Kubernetes environment. Which configuration change should they implement?
  - Configure the zPages endpoint to listen on 0.0.0.0:55679
- In the Schema File structure, what must the 'schema_url' correspond to?
  - The highest version number listed in the 'versions' section.
- What is the benefit of associating statements with the correct context in the transform processor?
  - It improves performance by leveraging context-specific processing.

## Analysis

The failed questions highlight specific areas within the debugging and maintenance of observability pipelines that require more attention:

1. **Metric Data Structures (ExponentialHistograms):** Two questions focus on the specifics of ExponentialHistograms, particularly how they handle zero values (`zero_count`, `zero_threshold`) and their merging behavior according to the specification. This indicates a need to deepen understanding of this specific metric type.
2. **Collector Debugging (zPages):** One question targets the practical application of `zPages` for debugging the OpenTelemetry Collector, especially its network configuration within a Kubernetes environment. This suggests focusing on the operational aspects of Collector debugging tools.
3. **OpenTelemetry Schema:** A question about the Schema File structure, specifically the `schema_url` requirement, points towards needing a better grasp of how OpenTelemetry manages schema evolution and identification.
4. **Collector Processing (Transform Processor):** The question regarding the transform processor's context highlights the need to understand how specific processors operate and optimize their performance.

**Recommendations for Study:**

- **ExponentialHistograms:** Review the [OpenTelemetry Metrics Data Model specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/data-model.md#exponentialhistogram), paying close attention to the sections defining `ExponentialHistogram` fields (`zero_threshold`, `zero_count`) and the rules for merging points.
- **Collector zPages:** Study the [OpenTelemetry Collector `zpages` extension documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/zpagesextension). Focus on configuration options, particularly network binding (`endpoint`), and how it's used for troubleshooting.
- **OpenTelemetry Schema:** Read the [OpenTelemetry Schema specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/schemas/overview.md) and the [Schema File Format](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/schemas/file_format.md) documentation to understand the structure, purpose, and rules governing schema files, including the `schema_url`.
- **Transform Processor:** Consult the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib `transform` processor documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/transformprocessor). Understand its syntax (OTTL), available contexts (spans, metrics, logs), and how using the correct context impacts processing logic and efficiency.
